# COM3D2.BYODifficulty
A plugin for configuring your game difficulty, mostly aimed at making the game harder.

## Why

COM is too easy. Some people don't like things easy, they want a little challenge in their management sim. This is meant to hopefully achieve that by adding a variety of configurable options and some minor consequences.

## Features

- Income Multiplier: Multiply money you earn by a multiplier that can either reduce or increase money earned.
- Income Subtractions: Basically taxes, bills, etc,. Money you lose at the end of every day for operating.
- Bill Per Facility: How much each facility costs to maintain every day.
- Maid Work Wage: Maids are paid for their work, this is how much they're paid for working on something.
- Maid Cut of Earnings: Maids bring in the money and get a cut of the earnings.
- Maid Base Wage: Maids are paid for simply being hired by the club. They're given this much money at the end of the day simply because they're employed.
- Maid Contract Type Multipliers: Certain contracts pay the maid more or less. This decides how each contract modifies a maid's payout.
- Club Gauge Debuff: Your clubs gauge is multipled by this amount when you're in debt.
- Club Grade Debuff: Same as above but for club grade.
- Club Gauge Penalty: If you fail to pay your bills, you'll find yourself losing club gauge.
- Club Gauge Multiplier: By how much to multiply increases. This value moves kinda fast, this should help slow it down.
- Bankruptcy: If you're ever in so much debt that you cannot feasibly continue, you'll get a game over. However, if you have a maid that can be sold, you may sell them to pull yourself out of debt.
